# almostIncreasingSequence

Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.

Note: sequence `a[0]`, `a[1]`, ..., `a[n]` is considered to be a strictly increasing if `a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n]`. Sequence containing only one element is also considered to be strictly increasing.

## Example

* For `sequence = [1, 3, 2, 1]`, the output should be

  `almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = false`.

  There is no one element in this array that can be removed in order to get a strictly increasing sequence.

* For `sequence = [1, 3, 2]`, the output should be
  
  `almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = true`.

  You can remove `3` from the array to get the strictly increasing sequence `[1, 2]`. Alternately, you can remove `2` to get the strictly increasing sequence `[1, 3]`.

## Input/Output

* [**execution time limit**] 4 seconds (py3)
* [**input**] array.integer `sequence`
    * Guaranteed constraints:
      * `2 â‰¤ sequence.length â‰¤ 100,000`.
      * `-100,000 â‰¤ sequence[i] â‰¤ 100,000`.
* [**output**] boolean
    
    Return `true` if it is possible to remove one element from the array in order to get a strictly increasing sequence, otherwise return `false`.

```python
def almostIncreasingSequence(sequence):
    found = 0
    
    # Two elements are always true.
    if(len(sequence) == 2): return True
    
    # found at the first element
    if(sequence[0] >= sequence[1]):
        found += 1
    
    for i in range(1, len(sequence) - 1):   
        
        # found non-increasing    
        if(sequence[i] >= sequence[i+1]):
            found += 1
            if(found == 2):
                return False
            
            # remove i
            if(sequence[i-1] < sequence[i+1]):
                continue
                
            # last element     
            if(i+2 >= len(sequence)):
                return True
                
            # remove i + 1   
            if(sequence[i] < sequence[i+2]) :
                continue
            return False
    return True
```

`sequence.length` is very long. 

**execution time limit exceeded:** when using O(n<sup>2</sup>) algorithm

`almostIncreasingSequence` is always `true`. when `sequence.length` is 2

Next check, when the first element is greater than the second element . Skip it and count `found` as 1

Next. Finds each element when the current element is greater than the next. Check if non-increasing element has been found before? 

if true, this array is not in the `almostIncreasingSequence` condition

If not, select the elements to remove.

now, there are 2 cases.

first cases:

The problem is that i<sup>th</sup> element. when removing i<sup>th</sup> element then
previously element < next element (still in  `almostIncreasingSequence` condition)

second cases:

The problem is that i+1<sup>th</sup> element. when removing i+1<sup>th</sup> element then
current element < the next 2 index (i+2<sup>th</sup>) element (still in  `almostIncreasingSequence` condition)

until all elements in the array.
